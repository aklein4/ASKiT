## Overview

Stanford CS224N Final Project. A multi-hop reasoning text-based question-answer NLP model to address the research question: "What if language models could ask their own questions?"

## Logistics

 - For each feature/model, there is a seperate branch with relevant information in its README. 
 - To avoid large file hell, there is a google drive that we can use to share data. Put this data in a folder named local_data to avoid it getting pushed.
 
## Brainstorming

 - When collecting facts, how do we decide to just grab another sentence from the corpus vs asking a question?
