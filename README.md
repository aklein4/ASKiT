## Overview

Stanford CS224N Final Project. A multi-hop reasoning text-based question-answer NLP model to address the research question: "What if language models could ask their own questions?"

## Logistics

 - For each feature/model, there is a seperate branch with relevant information in its README. 
 - To avoid large file hell, there is a google drive that we can use to share data. Put this data in a folder named local_data to avoid it getting pushed.

## To Do

 1. Responder, FactInverter, Phraser
 2. Manager
 3. Asker
 4. Manager w/ questions as actions

## Brainstorming

 - It seems that if you make a small change to ASKiT - allowing it to replace statements in the corpus with its questions, rather than just expanding the F set - then the program becomes Turing complete.
